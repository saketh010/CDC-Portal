## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these simple steps to get the app up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neem-Sheth/CDC-Portal.git
cd CDC-Portal
```

### 2. Add a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the required environment variables:

```bash
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/your_database_name
EMAIL_SERVICE=your_email_service
EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

💡 **Note**: Replace placeholders with actual values.

### 3. Build and Run the Docker Container

Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build the application Docker image. 🔨
- Start the application and MongoDB services. 🚀

### 4. Access the Application

Once everything is up and running, open your browser and go to:

🌍 **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**
